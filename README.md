# Software Tester

## Project 1: Automated Testing Framework for a Web Application  

### Objective  
Create an automated testing framework for end-to-end testing of a web application.  

### Description  
Develop an automated testing suite using Selenium or a similar framework to test the functionality of a web application.
Implement test cases for UI, functionality, and performance testing. 
Generate reports and analyze test results.  

### Technologies Used  
- **ISTQB 4**  
- **Jira**  
- **Postman**  
- **Automated Testing**  
- **Selenium**  
- **Test Case Development**  
- **Performance Testing**

## 📅 Week 1: Setup and Test Case Development  

### Tasks  
✅ **Set up testing environment:** Install and configure Selenium WebDriver or an equivalent framework for automated testing.<br>
✅ **Organize project structure:** Create a structured folder for test scripts and reports.<br>
✅ **Develop initial test cases for basic UI functionality** (e.g., navigation, button clicks, form submissions ).<br>
✅ **Postman Integration:** Set up Postman for API testing and create basic test cases to verify API responses.<br>
✅ **Jira Integration:** Implement Jira for managing test cases and tracking issues found during testing.<br>

### Deliverables  
✔️ Functional testing environment set up (Selenium/WebDriver).  <br>
✔️ Organized folder structure for test scripts.  <br>
✔️ Initial test cases developed for UI and API functionality.<br>
✔️ Postman configured for API testing.  <br>
✔️ Jira integrated for tracking test cases and bugs.<br>

## 📅 Week 2: Functional Testing and Report Generation  

### Tasks  
✅ **Develop functional test cases:** Write detailed test cases to cover key functional workflows (e.g., user login, form submission, data processing).<br>
✅ **Automated test scripts:** Automate the execution of functional tests using Selenium. <br>
✅ **Implement report generation:** Integrate tools like TestNG or JUnit to generate detailed test reports with test results.<br>
✅ **API test cases:** Expand API testing in Postman by adding more endpoints and verifying data . <br>
✅ **Performance testing setup:** Install and configure tools for performance testing (e.g., JMeter, Gatling). <br>

### Deliverables  
✔️ Comprehensive functional test cases written and automated. <br> 
✔️ Test reports generated for UI and functional test cases. <br>
✔️ Expanded API testing in Postman.   <br>
✔️ Performance testing setup ready for execution. <br>

## 📅 Week 3: Performance and UI Testing  

### Tasks  
✅ **Develop performance test cases:** Write test cases for load and stress testing using tools like JMeter or Gatling.<br>
✅ **Execute performance tests:** Run performance tests on the web application to analyze response times, load handling, and scalability.<br>
✅ **UI testing:** Enhance UI test cases to cover more complex scenarios (e.g., responsive design, cross-browser compatibility).<br>
✅ **Bug tracking:** Log and track issues in Jira discovered during the execution of performance and UI tests.<br>

### Deliverables  
✔️ Performance tests executed and results analyzed for scalability and load performance. <br>
✔️ Detailed UI test cases covering different browsers and device types.<br>
✔️ Bug tracking in Jira with proper issue management workflows.<br>

---

## 📅 Week 4: Final Testing, Optimization, and Deployment  

### Tasks  
✅ **Optimize test framework:** Refactor the test framework to optimize performance and reusability (e.g., using page object models).<br>
✅ **Execute full testing suite:** Run the complete suite of tests (UI, functional, API, performance) on the web application.<br>
✅ **Analyze test results:** Review and analyze the results, identifying any remaining issues.<br>
✅ **Generate final reports:** Create detailed reports summarizing the results of all tests, including performance metrics.<br>
✅ **Documentation:** Write detailed documentation on the automated testing framework, how to use it, and how to add new test cases.<br>
✅ **Deploy the framework:** Make the testing framework ready for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., integration with Jenkins).<br>

### Deliverables  
✔️ Fully optimized and functional automated testing framework.<br>
✔️ Complete execution of UI, functional, API, and performance tests.<br>
✔️ Final test reports and bug analysis.<br>
✔️ Comprehensive documentation for using and extending the testing framework.<br>
✔️ Testing framework integrated into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.<br>
