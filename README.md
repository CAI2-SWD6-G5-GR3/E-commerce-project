# Software Tester

## Project 1: Automated Testing Framework for a Web Application  

### Objective  
Create an automated testing framework for end-to-end testing of a web application.  

### Description  
Develop an automated testing suite using Selenium or a similar framework to test the functionality of a web application.
Implement test cases for UI, functionality, and performance testing. 
Generate reports and analyze test results.  

### Technologies Used  
- **ISTQB 4**  
- **Jira**  
- **Postman**  
- **Automated Testing**  
- **Selenium**  
- **Test Case Development**  
- **Performance Testing**

## 📅 Week 1: Setup and Test Case Development  

### Tasks  
✅ Set up testing environment: Install and configure Selenium WebDriver or an equivalent framework for automated testing.<br>
✅ Organize project structure: Create a structured folder for test scripts and reports.<br>
✅ Develop initial test cases for basic UI functionality (e.g., navigation, button clicks, form submissions ).<br>
✅ **Postman Integration:** Set up Postman for API testing and create basic test cases to verify API responses.<br>
✅ **Jira Integration:** Implement Jira for managing test cases and tracking issues found during testing.<br>

### Deliverables  
✔️ Functional testing environment set up (Selenium/WebDriver).  
✔️ Organized folder structure for test scripts.  
✔️ Initial test cases developed for UI and API functionality.
✔️ Postman configured for API testing.  
✔️ Jira integrated for tracking test cases and bugs.

## 📅 Week 2: Functional Testing and Report Generation  

### Tasks  
✅ Develop functional test cases: Write detailed test cases to cover key functional workflows (e.g., user login, form submission, data processing).
✅ Automated test scripts: Automate the execution of functional tests using Selenium. 
✅ Implement report generation: Integrate tools like TestNG or JUnit to generate detailed test reports with test results.
✅ API test cases: Expand API testing in Postman by adding more endpoints and verifying data
✅ Performance testing setup: Install and configure tools for performance testing (e.g., JMeter, Gatling).

### Deliverables  
✔️ Comprehensive functional test cases written and automated.  
✔️ Test reports generated for UI and functional test cases.
✔️ Expanded API testing in Postman.  
✔️ Performance testing setup ready for execution.

## 📅 Week 3: Performance and UI Testing  

### Tasks  
✅ Develop performance test cases: Write test cases for load and stress testing using tools like JMeter or Gatling.
✅ Execute performance tests: Run performance tests on the web application to analyze response times, load handling, and scalability
✅ UI testing: Enhance UI test cases to cover more complex scenarios (e.g., responsive design, cross-browser compatibility).
✅ Bug tracking: Log and track issues in Jira discovered during the execution of performance and UI tests.

### Deliverables  
✔️ Performance tests executed and results analyzed for scalability and load performance. 
✔️ Detailed UI test cases covering different browsers and device types.
✔️ Bug tracking in Jira with proper issue management workflows.

---

## 📅 Week 4: Final Testing, Optimization, and Deployment  

### Tasks  
✅ Optimize test framework: Refactor the test framework to optimize performance and reusability (e.g., using page object models).
✅ Execute full testing suite: Run the complete suite of tests (UI, functional, API, performance) on the web application.
✅ Analyze test results: Review and analyze the results, identifying any remaining issues.
✅ Generate final reports: Create detailed reports summarizing the results of all tests, including performance metrics
✅ Documentation: Write detailed documentation on the automated testing framework, how to use it, and how to add new test cases.
✅ Deploy the framework: Make the testing framework ready for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., integration with Jenkins).

### Deliverables  
✔️ Fully optimized and functional automated testing framework.
✔️ Complete execution of UI, functional, API, and performance tests.
✔️ Final test reports and bug analysis.
✔️ Comprehensive documentation for using and extending the testing framework.
✔️ Testing framework integrated into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing
